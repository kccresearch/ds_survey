As I observed, binabalewala niyo lang ang sitwasyon ng isang empleyado pagdating sa trabaho. Mas mabigat at matinding pagod ang mga nasa baba. Be considerate naman kasi hindi sila ROBOT, TAO sila na napapagod din at nanghihina. Ok ang pakikitungo niyo sa customer pero sa sariling empleyado napaka strict niyo. Hindi lalago ang business niyo kung hindi dahil sa mga taong nasa baba. Position lang yan pero tao rin kayo at nakikita niyo yung paghihirap. Wag masyadong feeling may-ari ng store. Mas ok pa siguro ang may-ari nakakaramdam kaysa sa mga may position na feeling hindi nakakaramdam.	Phone number (interested for further research)	09926177553

You have to explain to them that you are using card or gift cert for payment. Otherwise, they won't let you. Also, bringing backpacks aren't allowed, still. SM malls allow whatever bag inside their department store. KCC should impose security measures at the exits instead of bringing inconvenience to the shoppers. We have to leave our bags from distant baggage areas and hand carry our big gadgets such as iPads and laptops on top of our wallets and phones. Also, the security guys outside the department store are sometimes rude if you get past their "coloring" of the receipts. My 8 yr old daughter was held like a thief when she went past these security guys with a toy we just bought. We were treated like criminals when it took time to locate the receipt of the toy that went under the plastic bag of our other purchases. The service of other employees are nonetheless impressive as they are mostly helpful to our needs. However, the "security measure" are so inconvenient, impractical and primitive. If other malls can, why KCC can't?	Phone number (only contacted for the promo)	09550014937

It's really helpful especially when you forgot to bring toiletries with you such as tissue. Also, bidets too! although I don't normally use the toilet at malls but it's great to have it on your stalls. Lastly, about the hand dryers, I don't know if the cleaning staff cleans and disinfect it but sometimes it smells funky kase that's why I don't really use it and i just stick to drying my hands with tissue paper and that maybe is also a reason to have free toilet paper in the comfort rooms!
